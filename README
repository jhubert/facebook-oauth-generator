A generator for a Rails application that uses facebook oauth for it's user accounts.

Basic usage to get up and running:

rails new MyNewApp
cd MyNewApp
mkdir lib/generators/
git clone git@github.com:jhubert/facebook-oauth-generator.git ./lib/generators/facebook_oauth
rails g facebook_oauth
rake db:migrate
rails server

In order to actually use it to connect to facebook, you will have to put your facebook application details in the following file:

config/facebook.yml

Also, I'm aware that a patch isn't the best way to go about this. I plan on building a full generator at some point, but this was all I had time for today. If you want to take on the task of doing it properly, then by all means. :)
